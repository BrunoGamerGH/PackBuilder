# PackBuilder

Tool to convert resource packs from 1.6-1.19, and vice versa

# (CURRENTLY IN BETA)

# How can I get it?

You can simply go to the [releases](https://github.com/BrunoGamerGH/PackBuilder/releases) and select any version you would like.

## How does it work?

You put all the important files in the **assets** folder, theres a main **minecraft** directory which you can put all default textures (like blocks, items) and support for extra folders other than the main minecraft one (for custom textures you dont want to put in the **minecraft** directory).

## How to run?

There's 2 ways to run it, with the .bat file alocated with the file, or by running `java -jar PackBuilder.jar` in any terminal.

## Why is it not converting?

Sometimes I might have made a spelling mistake, if you see any file that didn't convert correctly, create an [issue](https://github.com/BrunoGamerGH/PackBuilder/issues) and It might be fixed soon.

## How can I help?

I am working on this alone, and the current method is not the best, so i'd recommend people who want to create a branch/fork, create a pull request and, depending on the updates i might accept.
